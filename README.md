# KenoAi
KenoAi is a keno prediction artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to predict numbers of next draw in kino games.

## If you need powerfull and advanced AI's with GUI, you can get the compiled standalone applications from here:

### LotteryAI+ for Windows 11 OS from here:

This AI is optimised for CUDA and Threadripper and multiple GPUs.
## Installation

To install KenoAi, you will need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:
- numpy
- tensorflow
- keras
- art

You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:

'''pip install numpy tensorflow keras art'''

## Usage

To use KenoAi, you will need to have a data (data.txt) file containing past keno results. This file should be in a comma-separated format, with each row representing a single draw and the numbers in descending order, rows are in new line without comma. Dont use white spaces. Last row number must have nothing after last number.

Once you have the data file, you can run the `KenoAi` script to train the model and generate predictions. The script will print the generated next draw with 20 numbers to the console.
